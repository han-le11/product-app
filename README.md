This is an integration service that fetches product data from a public e-commerce API. The goal is to group products by their categories and save the results in a structured JSON format.

To build and run the app, please navigate to `ProductAggregator`
```
cd ProductAggregator
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

The output JSON file of products grouped by their categories can be found in `grouped_products.json`.
